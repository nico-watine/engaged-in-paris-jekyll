Please do not feel that you have to buy us a wedding gift. Your presence at our wedding is the greatest gift of all. However if you wish to honour us with a gift, we have set up a savings registry through this website, honeyfund.com. 

Your gift will be put towards our #teamwatine savings, our future home and our honeymoon.
